                    <p>Chianna...</p>
                    <p>The last 22 days were some of the best days of my life.. When we found each other, i was lost and you were broken.. You were all gloomy and sad when we started and i was almost the same.. Then after every line we spoke each other.. Both of us felt that changing.. We were almost feeling the same way thst time.. speaking the same kind of words... We found our way inside to each others souls so easily, which was in a deadlock for so long.. We couldn't stop talking.. Everything we spoke we were so similar.. We thought about life the same way.. We were both only children.. we were both hurt.. We are both 24.. We jinxed each other when we spoke.. And we just couldnt let go of each other.. And as we spoke to each other.. 2e were healing.. that fast... like it was all waiting for this to happen now.. and together, we made each other the happiest people in this world.. It was you and me against this world.. We are fighting and winning together..</p>
                    <p>I do not care who you are.. what you do.. what you looked like.. or how rich you are..  i did not even force to tell you those things in the beginning seeing you were protective of it.. Because any of those donot matter to me.. not then.. not now.. not ever.. you reached me.. pulled me back up from somewhere deep down i was lost that night.. and made me smile wide.. and cry out of joy.. and that is enough.. nothing else matters.. coz that will make me do things.. and go far.. anywhere i want to go.. coz i m that good.. with the right frame of mind.. </p>
                    <p>I was in a dreamland.. doing things that i never did before in my life.. I felt energetic every day even with the minimal sleep and disrupted schedule.. I, who struggled to get up at 8am until then for recent years was up at 2am every night, and never slept after that.. I wrote the most beautiful words and poems like i never wrote for my whole life.. I smiled, laughed and was cheerful at everyone everytime of the day like i was never for the last 12 years.. I scored more than double of the last highest score in a game i played (trust me its not easy).. I worked with such passion and perfection that things were flowing as i meant them to.. My mind, my most powerful weapon.. was more strong and sharp than it was before 8 years.. Things were becoming effortless again.. I did not watch any movie, or read any book or watch any tv series all this time.. I did not chat with any others except official during this time.. I just worked.. worked out.. and be with you all these 22 days.. And yet.. i am the happiest guy in this world.. I love you like i love no one else.. </p>
                    <p> All of this happened with such pace that i could not even believe it myself that i was doing such things with such ease and happiness without even getting tired much.. Seeing you happy.. made me the most happiest person.. and you deserve all the love and happiness in this world.. I never confessed or confided myself to anyone like i did to you.. you are my soulmate..</p>
                    <p>But I understood that all of this was just felt by me.. You did not feel the same way.. So i expected very less of this to last long.. I just wanted to make sure you were healthy and happy.. Until... </p>
                    <p>One night.. you were not drunk.. and you were saying again and again that you really loved me.. you fell for me.. and you never wanted to let go ever.. i knew what love did to me.. if what you said were true, and you were in love, i just cant let you go.. and i wont.. love makes us do the impossible.. believe me.. it does.. </p>
                    <p>We dont need to be together for that.. we are together in our mind and soul.. i m yours.. and you are mine.. find the strength that you found in me.. i am so strong now.. i will fight.. i will beat it.. i will win.. find that strength and take it with you.. you are already strong.. and you also will have this strength you will find now.. you will fight.. you will beat it..  and i will see you through as you do it.. and i ll keep smiling as you win.. you are the strongest woman.. keep that intact.. show it to the world.. show it to me.. show us how you will win.. because you will win chianna.. i know you will.. never give yourself up in life.. never do it.. coz im here with you.. all the way.. always.. you will not stumble.. you will just flow past it.. and it will helplessly look at you as you beat it hands down.. Coz you are that much strong.. and you are smart.. you have the best people to treat it around you.. and best people to care for you.. and you have me with you.. you will find a way.. and you will win.. believe me.. you will.. </p>
                    <p>Keep smiling.. Because smile is the official logo of strength.. You are COO.. You know how important brand logos are.. Always keep it upright and display it wherever possible..</p>
                    <p>And your brand will never fade.. Nor will your logo..</p>
                    <p>I love you.. ‚ù§</p>
