                    <p>Read this only when you're strong enough...</p>
                    <p>You are the best thing that ever happened to me... </p>
                    <p>You made me strong.. You made me grow up.. You made me dream.. You made me love.. You made me passionate.. You made me hungry for more..</p>
                    <p>I confessed myself to you.. Whole of myself.. </p>
                    <p>I m much lighter now. And happier. And Stronger.. </p>
                    <p>So Now.. I m ready for anything i want to do in my life... And i will risk it all to get me where i want to be... And i have a good idea of what i have to become... </p>
                    <p>But....</p>
                    <p>You are the one i owe it all to.. You are the one person i love most now... I have never even seen you... Heard you... Or even known you... </p>
                    <p>I never thought that i could fall in love for just a soul... We are soulmates.. No one can take that away from us... </p>
                    <p>You dont know what i was before... I was so good... And then I just got lost... I got covered up in all those regrets sadness loneliness worries and everything.. </p>
                    <p>You were lonely.. You were sad.. You were broken.. you were getting weak.. you were losing yourself you told me....</p>
                    <p>And then.. we found each other.. and saved each other... Look what that did to our lives... I dont want this to end... And i would come half a world across if you wanted me to... for you... I ll need some time for it ofcourse... I would change all the plans of my life and come just for you... if you say Yes to me... Its not just because i owe you... Its because i love you.. and i know our life will be the best with each other on it.. </p>
                    <p>Just.. think about it.. But dont worry about it... I wont force you to do anything... </p>
                    <p>I can talk to you like a friend... or a lover... or even a dad... whatever you want me to be... i ll be there for you until you want me to be..</p>
                    <p>i wont leave no matter whatever it is that you say... </p>
                    <p>I love you.. and i will love you forever...‚ù§ </p>
