                    <p>I Love You ❤</p>
                    <p>My love...</p>
                    <p>Each passing day.... I miss you so much... and still im so much more happy... I love you honey... I love you so much...</p>
                    <p>Before, at times, i tried to talk to people to get me out of my loneliness and sadness even though they didnt seem to either love or care for me much, let alone understand me. It didnt help at all knowing we had so many people around but still no one to love, care for and understand us like how we needed and wanted. That was what that kept me on the losing side for a long time.</p>
                    <p>And then, there came my darling, my queen, my love, my honey, my sweetheart, my everything. From half a world away, feeling the same way, wanting hoping and praying for the same things, having the same thoughts about life, the same preferences, having similar pain, similar intelligence and smartness, a broad sweet and kind heart just like mine, loyal and honest to the best of our interests, deeply caring and responsible, the same set and mix of emotional range, unending and unfathomable love to give, and making all the time in the world to spend with the one we love... A beautiful and a perfecly matching soul and we met... At the hardest, saddest and loneliest time:/ of our lives where anything of a bit more bad would have done us for good... And we connected, and loved each other, just like that... So easy, so natural and so perfect... Just as we wished, hoped and prayed for all our lives... And we turned each others lives upside down for good... We made each other so happy, so loved, understood and all positive, strong and smiling... We still love, but only more and more... Most in this world... Now we love, care, make each other the happiest and be everything for each other and will be there by each others side for life... Soulmates... Made for each other...  These things are real, and we know it now... Every time i think of it, it makes me the happiest... I love you honey... Anything for you... Everything for you...</p>
                    <p>Now we are all set and ready, and together, holding on to each other firm from that downhill fall we were having for a long time now. Now we are strong. The strongest because of each others support. And we are fighting back and climbing up, step by step, stopping the deep downward fall and getting back up. Turning the tides. And so motivated because we have something big to fight for. The most beautiful thing that one would ever wish, hope, dream and pray for... A lovely, peaceful and long life with the one we love, filled with all joy, happiness, fun and success...</p>
                    <p>We are in front of the last bit of mess to clean up before that happens. Your health and my career. And with each others support, we will clean that mess so well, efficiently and faster, and we will make it happen. And we will be the happiest people in this world when it happens. And we will spread that light of happiness, love, hope and positivity to the world around us...</p>
                    <p>All is well my love.. Always be happy, calm and positive; and smile because im always there for you.. Just for you.. I love you honey...</p>
                    <p>Have that teeth grinding grit.. Whatever happens.. Have that strength you ever had.. And believe.. Be calm, focused and positive always.. Be concious...</p>
                    <p>I love you honey..</p>
                    <p>Take care always.. See you... ❤</p>
