                    <br />
                    <p>I m really sad if i hurt you bad with my words last night. I didnot mean to hurt you the slightest. Its just that i was feeling not so good lately at times when i am not with you.</p>
                    <p>I love you most in this world. I trust you and believe in you. I know that you will do everything to heal yourself. I am always here to love you, support you, take care of you, calm you down, make you happy, make you love, make you believe, be there with you whenever you need and make you do it.</p>
                    <p>I do all the things I do to you because I love you that much. Yes I found you on an unlikely place, omegle where people dont keep things permanent. Even I never spent this much time here until I met you.  But we know what we are to each other. We met each other and changed our lives for good.</p>
                    <p>We are perfect for each other. That's the only reason we happen to love each other like this from this far and this lesser mode of communication, and without any former meeting. Thats why I really want to make this happen. I believe we will live a beautiful life together when we do.</p>
                    <p>When I think about what made me this disturbed lately, I think it was mainly because of two reasons.</p>
                    <p>1. When we met first up you said you were to be married soon. And later told it was sky and he will court you soon. I know and believe you love me most. I have no doubt in it. But I worry of the mental stress you will have if he courts you. I want you to set your mind to the core on us being together no matter what. In this state of adversity that is the only way I feel we can make this happen. With utmost determination and undeterred will and love. I want to convey this to you in a positive way to make yourself prepare for it. Dont worry yourself because whatever happens doesnt matter if you have set your mind and will onto us. You are that smart and efficient to make and find a way to make it happen and you have all the love and support of me always. And being a tech guy, I know to an extent what all will be the sort of holds access and network your people can have. So we will work around it efficiently. All I worry about is the extent of your willingness and determination to us.</p>
                    <p>2. This is somewhat related to the first reason but not entirely. We love each other like crazy right now and we spend all the spare time that you get together. We make time just to be with each other. And we are so happy and loved when we are together. And our lives have become a world better because of each other. For me, I love you just like I will love you when we are together.. no less.. And still for some reason, you still are reluctant about showing and telling about yourself  to me. This is okay and it doesnt bother me much. But, you never talk about meeting me or us being together unless forced to do so. I know about your health condition and I understand it takes time belief and much effort to get back to health. And I also trust and belive that you will be back to healthy. Im here for that. For making you loved cared happy determined hopeful positive and more. You must always be positive. The way to be positive is to talk positively. In our case, talking positively means to talk about our future together. I believe talking sbout it makes us more and more motivated and wanting to the cause. A task of this difficulty needs a high degree of positivity to achieve it efficiently and sooner. Whenever I start talking about that you at most times tend to keep silent or change topic or doze off. I maybe wrong and it may not be intentional. But it disturbs me all the same. And not once has a word come from your side about our future together without being forced to talk about it. This bothers me more.</p>
                    <p>Honey, Im not someone who is a flirt and take people easily and I know that you are not too. If Im into someone Im into the core. And for you Im all in. I love you and I do everything I can to you from what you allow me to do. And knowing you love me too I have set my mind to do anything necessary to make this happen. I dont want to end up a broken man. I want us to be positive, talk positive, be honest, work smart as a team and make this happen. And I want to be informed of whatever that is going on. We will be together my love. We are the two happiest people in this world who will be together.</p>
                    <p>Thats what we are. The best team, the best couple, the best soulmates. We complete each other.</p>
                    <p>I love you most in this world honey. Lets love laugh and and live long happy and peaceful together.</p>
                    <p>I love you ‚ù§</p>
