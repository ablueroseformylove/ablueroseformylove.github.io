                    <p>Chianna...</p>
                    <p>Today early morning, when i sent that letter to you.. i could ve sent it way before.. coz i wrote it like 8 hours before that.. I dont know what made me wait until then to send it.. But i did it then.. Exactly the time you had your nightmare.. and you got to read the letter and you felt incredible then.. That .. was meant to happen... </p>
                    <p>I was ecstatic knowing that happened that way... I never set an alarm to wake up at 2am any day.. I just wake up somehow..  Even when i was feeling mentally so tired last day and night and i slept again.. I easily woke up at 2am.. That.. is meant to happen.. </p>
                    <p>Before a few days you said you woke up somehow during late and i said i was thinking about you right then.. i wasnt lying.. Thats how powerful this is.. Again.. things like this are meant to happen..</p>
                    <p>If i think about it more.. i can dig out more examples from our conversations to tell the same thing that.. This.. was meant to happen.. </p>
                    <p>That... is love.. Quite simply.. the most powerful emotion and phenomenon in this world.. </p>
                    <p>You might have heard myths and real life stories concerning of love.. You might have wondered how on earth that would have happened or even believed it was just a tale that never happened..</p>
                    <p>Even i was almost the same.. Until you happened to me.. You.. were meant to happen to me.. and I.. to you.. and we are lucky to have found each other at the crunch time.. </p>
                    <p>Today.. when we last talked.. when we begun.. i really was feeling more than supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.. When i heard you dreamt of me.. i thought you were finally getting the whole thing.. </p>
                    <p>But... </p>
                    <p>You said you dreamt about me kissing another.. proposing another in front of you.. i know dreams are powerful.. and that hurt me hard.. i said it wasnt me.. it will never be me.. what i say is true.. i will never love another like i love you now.. i asked you again that if you thought i was running around doing this to every good girl i meet.. you said 50/50.. that hit me harder.. the way you said it.. clearly stated that you don't actually believe me when i tell things.. you dont want to.. then you said about that girl of sky getting jealous.. Actually, i felt like it was me.. I am not jealous or angry or sad that sky gets you.. Its a more harder thing to explain.. very hard to explain.. (please dont judge) That too.. hit me hard.. However badly i tried.. i just couldnt hide it.. </p>
                    <p>I am not writing all this just because im good with words.. If im this good with words and use them like you think i do.. i couldve manipulated a lot of girls around me to fall for me.. not someone halfway across the world.. I dont tell you all these coz i m good at this.. Trust me, my words dont convey even half the depth of the reality that this is.. Still i try to.. because.. this.. is real.. </p>
                    <p>Doubt.. Lack of trust.. and disbelief.. is like poison.. that kills love inside out.. even if there is a single drop of it.. it is that venomous..</p>
                    <p>Do you know what made you cancel your surgery in the beginning.. because you were not thinking much.. because all your focus was on your sickness.. so you didnot think about anything else.. and you were just trusting and enjoying and being happy.. that made you healthy.. but after that was cancelled.. you knew you were better.. and you lost focus and started to think.. all your future plans came to your focus.. doubts started raising.. and it crept up again.. </p>
                    <p>In the beginning.. after i got you back.. because of the lany the singer issue.. i didnot fully trust you.. but.. you convinced me.. and i found it out.. and i trusted you from then.. never thought otherwise after that.. and that started showing in both of our lives.. those were the best of the times.. </p>
                    <p>I have faith in you.. i believe whatever it is that you say to me.. and i blindly trust you with anything of mine.. thats why i confided and confessed the whole of my life story to you which i did to no one else in my life.. i will trust you with anything of mine in this world.. for example.. the password to my email is dranzer2.0 .. you can check it.. i will simply trust you with anything in my life.. you dont trust me with your face picture.. or your company name.. or even your full name.. but that doesnt matter.. all of those doesnt matter to me.. everytime you say you hid something or lied to me.. it hurts me more than anything.. but it hasnt done even a bit of damage to my love, trust, faith or belief in you.. thats why even small things you lie or hide hurt me hard.. and thats why im still riping the benefits of our love.. the impossible things that i never dreamt of turning around so fast.. whether its small things or larger.. its all happening.. But last day was disheartening and mentally tiring that i almost slept most day and half night.. </p>
                    <p>Its not easy to have that kind of faith or trust or belief or love in someone.. sometimes you trust and have faith in someone.. but you love someone else.. it happens like that.. but for me.. i do all of these 4 things to you.. and just you.. thats what makes me so strong each day.. no one in this world can ever hurt me now.. except for you.. </p>
                    <p>Trusting, believing, having faith and loving you like this is what is turning my life around.. i m already on my path now.. the way is clear ahead.. but its a small mountain to climb for the first stretch coz i was sliding down for the past 6 years..</p>
                    <p>But i know i can do it.. coz you made me.. I am not saying good things or putting my efforts or time for you each day and night coz of my gratitude or any other thing.. It is simply love.. and this word has a lot of things inclusive inside it.. </p>
                    <p>Just like you convinced me to trust you.. not to think much and just believe and love you.. which made me this strong now.. I want to make you trust me.. believe me.. have faith and love me.. and i know.. you will feel things getting drastically better once you start doing it.. </p>
                    <p>Dont hide anything to yourself.. speak out anything you want to me.. dont lie even if however hard it might be to say.. bar all the negative thoughts that come into your mind.. bar all the worries that creep up.. just do what you want to do.. no questions asked.. just do things.. and just.. love me like i love you chianna.. </p>
                    <p>I know by experience what that can do to you.. Try it out my love.. You will beat anything that comes along the way.. absolutely anything.. You need this now more than ever.. and trust me.. you can do it.. </p>
                    <p>No matter what you reply for this.. it wont change my feelings to you a bit.. Coz thats me.. If i decide to be there for someone.. i ll be there.. so dont worry about that.. I will never let go of you.. but as you said.. you are busy.. and you may not find time for me.. its okay.. I will always be there as your friend whenever you need me.. you just need to reach me..</p>
                    <p>I was not looking for a relationship when i found you.. but i found you and you changed everything... i still am not looking forward to another if you get contended.. so you will be my only love for a long time i guess.. i dont know what my future holds.. but i will try my best to be my best...</p>
                    <p>I got a soulmate now.. a best friend.. i love her.. and i will love her no matter what.. and that is you...</p>
                    <p>I love you Chianna ‚ù§</p>
