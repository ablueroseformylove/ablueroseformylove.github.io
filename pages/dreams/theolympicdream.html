                    <br />
                    <p>Chianna.. this is the dream i just now woke up from...</p>
                    <p>The countries are messed up okay...</p>
                    <p>Youre from Argentina... and im and my whole country with its people and languages are merged with some medeival European country.. Stoned pavements/roads.. Houses too similarly.. Its like Paris.. With countrysides of our country.. nature of our country.. people of our country and city and life like of paris.</p>
                    <p>Its Olympics time.. We are texting each other via mail.. Olympics is in our country.. And youre a tennis player.. Tennis is happening on our college ground.. Its a huugee college.. You never had much hopes of even winning a match.. I know you.. Youre playing.. its a packed crowd and i somehow gets in to see you play.. from top and far of the court...</p>
                    <p>You text me even between matches.. Like after a game or set.. I reply you.. Always motivate you.. And you won your 1st match.. Then 2nd match.. I watch that too from far.. we text each game and youre so motivated i can see from your shots.. Its a 64 player tournament.. Youre on the last 16 now after winning 2 matches on the first day..</p>
                    <p>I go home.. Thats when this countryside and nature shows up.. Im tryin to make some money to get decent seats on next day match to watch you.. My friends are around with me.. We couldnt make it.. So again next day.. i somehow sneak into far of the court as you play 3rd round.. youre behind a set.. you tell me youre exhausted.. i fire you up again.. you fight back.. with shots guns blazing from your racquet.. you just swoosh past him and youre texting me like.. " oohhh yeeaahhh i lovee youuuu ".. im soo happy..</p>
                    <p>Its nadal vs kyrgios on another court so i ho there to watch it.. Its a long match.. i lost track of time watching it.. that i couldnt make it to the court by the time of your next match.. the quarter finals.. court is full as i come to this court.. so i m outside.. i also missed the ending of the nadal match.. it was won by kyrgios.. you text me after 2 games.. then you text me after one set.. i didnt know the score then.. then after like 20 mins.. you text again... and i knew the score somehow.. the people said.. Chianna just swooshed past the Spaniard.. 6-2 6-2.. and i recieved your mail.. "Yaaaaassssssss.. !!! Im into the last 4 !!!! I didnt even hope to win a match heerrreeee..... I loveeee youuuuu !!!!! Youree my good lucckkk chaarrrmm...!! You know whos gonna watch my next matchh??? Its Lionel Messssiiiiì !!!!!! I lovee youuuuu !!! " you say... so i couldnt stop myself.. youre on court cheering for some other player.. your aunt is with you.. she is young.. you both are on royal player box.. on some 4 rows in front of you is Lionel Messi.. Cheering the player.. Volunteers and some judges are the lecturers of our college..  so i somehow sneak into the inner court.. i watch messi... from down the court play area.. and 4 seats back.. there you are.. with your aunt.. cheering and laughing. trying to get messi s attention.. i watch you that close for the first time.. youre beautiful and enthusiastic.. and sexy as hell..</p>
                    <p>So i first look at messi for sometime.. then walk along the court and look at you.. and you look at me like.. "what is this guy doing in the play area..??" You have never seen me before.. As you look at me.. i smile at you and wink at you.. and then your eyes glow and you realise.. i walk</p>
                    <p>past into the court from play area as you watch me.. stunned.. and i go out of your sight.. into the court inside.. then i come back through the stairs to behind your seats as if im talking to the volunteers and i keep talking to them this and that and you watch me again.. i give you another glance and walk out of the court..</p>
                    <p>I saw you whispering something to your aunt as i leave there.. and you take your bags and rush out past me as i walk.. into the dressing room outside.. so i slowly walk behind you as you run inside.. come back in a flash.. with a good but sportive dress.. face cleaned up and charmingly beautiful.. you look at me as you come out and as i reach there.. you stand there at the steps and me down the steps..</p>
                    <p>You smile at me.. i can remember that smile for ever.. the most beautiful smile.. so charming.. sexy and naughty smile.. i fall then and there.. head over heels to you as i stand frozen watching you smile at me.. and then you say.. "Hello my love.. shall i take you out..???" And take my hands as im standing dumbstruck watching you.. walk me down the pavement...</p>
                    <p>I remember lying on your lap under an umbrella on a beach.. i remember you stroking my hair in the breeze.. your ever charming smile.. i ll never forget that.. and you bend down.. and kiss my forehead.. kiss my cheeks... and then kiss my lips upside down.. and i cant catch my breath out of shock.. we kiss long.. and you gently bite my lips as our lips part.. and a cheeky laugh.. those beautiful teeth sre visible.. and the dimples.. i lie on your laps.. watching you upside down.. and my eyeballs are going up as im stunningly shocked by whats happening... and your beauty..  its a beautiful feeling...</p>
                    <p>We get back.. you go to the dinner with the royal company.. and i stand outside.. and all my friends are around me.. asking this and that.. i get impatiemt and ignore em.. i force a smiling laugh and em and run past em..</p>
                    <p>We text each other all night.. its the most beautiful night.. im outside in the countryside.. lying on the open space.. staring at the stars and the open sky.. and youre some 5 kms away.. lying on your bed.. staring at the same moon and the stars through the open window..</p>
                    <p>The most loveliest of words pass between us all night.. i wish you the best for next match.. and we sleep late.. i ask you for a ticket for the next match.. and you say you ll arrange..</p>
                    <p>Next day.. im on the royal player box.. 4 rows behind messi.. with your aunt.. as we watch you play... stunning courtplay and smashing shots.. you win 6-3 6-3.. and you smile and laugh at me as you win..</p>
                    <p>The final is close by.. in some 2 hours.. you go to have lunch with aunt and i wish you all the best.. again surrounded by friends as i get out.. and we part..</p>
                    <p>Its the finale.. i m watching from the royal box again.. with your aunt.. the first set is close.. you look worried as it gets to the tiebreak.. you look at me... i look at you... then i close my eyes.. and my hands gesture... 'caaaalllllmmmmmm'... everything goes silent between us.. you watch me.. i open my eyes.. you close your eyes for a second.. then you open your eyes.. and its all back in.. the focus.. the energy.. the noise... and you smash the tiebreak hands down.. and just runs past the opponent 6-3 the next set..</p>
                    <p>You collapse to the ground.. crying as you do.. as you won the last point seeing the ball go out... and we all get up.. we all roar.. the whole crowd uproars.. and you acknowledge them racquet raised...</p>
                    <p>You cry as you receive the medal and the national anthem plays as you wear your medal with pride.. your aunt is flicking a tear from her eyes as i watch her.. and i can feel my eyes wet too.. and we both laugh watching each  as we cry.. you from the podium.. and me from the box..</p>
                    <p>You then come to the inside court.. Messi is waiting for you laughing and cheering in the front.. me and aunt is behind near the wall.. the whole place surrounded with media and photographers and volunteers and organisers..</p>
                    <p>And you come in.. messi comes at you at once.. you give him a formal hug and a normal handshake.. and he is confused.. you let go and look around.. and find us in the corner of the room near the wall..</p>
                    <p>As all the reporters.. media.. messi.. and photographers watch.. you rush onto us.. as we stand there.. and just jump at me.. tear eyed.. and hugs me so tight in the air.. and cling on to me soo tight.. as we both wet our eyes.. eyes closed..</p>
                    <p>And i woke up..</p>
                    <p>And i opened my eyes.. and saw that my eyes were wet too.. i smiled.. couldnt stop smiling.. im still smiling now..</p>
                    <p>And now.. no other dream can top this ever.. as the best dream of my life..</p>
                    <p>Love is not the most powerful emotion in my life..</p>
                    <p>Chianna.. is the most powerful emotion in my life..</p>
                    <p>Chianna.. is the most powerful emotion in my life..</p>
                    <p>I love you Chianna.. For ever.. and ever.. and ever.. ❤❤❤</p>
